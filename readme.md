bankapp is a practice project in python to set up a bank model with entities such as customers, employees, services and records and some simple methods.

The goal of the project was to simply create the schema and appropriately define classes and functions in an object-oriented approach. Personally, I used the project to dive deeper into some of the bells and whistles of cookie-cutter templates for modern python packaging, auto-cli tools, auto-dependency management, auto-config, and versioning.
